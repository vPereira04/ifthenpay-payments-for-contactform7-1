## Description

This plugin integrates the ifthenpay payment gateway with Contact Form 7 to enable seamless payment collection directly from your forms.

Payments are processed through a secure pay-by-link system, ensuring that no sensitive card or banking data is stored on your website. After form submission, customers are redirected to a secure ifthenpay payment page where they finalize the transaction. ifthenpay then sends a server-side callback to automatically update the payment status in your entries.

### In plain terms you get:

* One-time payments directly from Contact Form 7 forms
* Secure automatic payment confirmations via callback
* Payment entries page to manage and track all transactions
* Revenue dashboard widget with period breakdown
* No card numbers stored on your website

All global settings are configured on the CF7 Integration page. Per-form settings (enable/disable, amount source) are managed inside each form editor.

## Key Features

1. Full integration with Contact Form 7 forms
2. Secure transactions via pay-by-link
3. Automatic payment confirmation via server-side callback
4. Support for multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, bank transfers)
5. Per-form configuration — enable payments and set amount source per form
6. Flexible amount — fixed price or read dynamically from any CF7 field
7. Payment entries page with filtering, search, bulk actions, and column customization
8. Revenue dashboard widget with last 24 h / 7 d / 15 d / 30 d breakdown
9. Admin bar shortcut and keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+F`) to Entries page
10. Multi-language support (EN, ES, FR, PT)
11. Security-first — no card data stored, anti-phishing key validation, HTTPS only

## Requirements

* An active ifthenpay merchant account — [subscribe here](https://ifthenpay.com/aderir/) to obtain your credentials.
* The payment methods you want enabled (our helpdesk team will guide you).
* WordPress 6.5+.
* PHP 8.2+.
* Contact Form 7 5.9+ installed and activated.
* HTTPS (SSL) enabled on your site.

## Installation

1. **Install**: Upload the plugin zip via `Plugins → Add New → Upload`, or install from WordPress.org and Activate.
2. **Connect**: Go to `Contact Form 7 → Integration → ifthenpay Payment Gateway`, enter your Backoffice Key, and click **Connect**.
3. **Configure**: Select your Gateway Key, enable payment methods, set a default method, description, and expiry days. Click **Save Configuration**.
4. **Per-form setup**: Open any form, go to the **ifthenpay Payment Gateway** tab, enable payments, and configure the payment amount (fixed or from a CF7 field).
5. **Add the tag**: Use the tag generator inside the form editor or type the tag manually into the form body. Remove the default Submit button — the `[ifthenpay_payment]` tag acts as the submit.

## Form Tag Reference

The `[ifthenpay_payment]` tag renders the payment button in the form. Place it once where the submit button should appear and remove the default `[submit]` tag.

```
[ifthenpay_payment amount:30.00]
[ifthenpay_payment amount:30.00 "Buy now" css:btn-primary hide:yes]
```

| Option | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `amount:X.XX` | Yes | Payment amount in euros. Use `.` or `,` as decimal separator. |
| `"Button text"` | No | Custom button label. Default: `Pay with ifthenpay`. |
| `css:"my-class"` | No | Extra CSS class appended to the button element. |
| `hide:yes` | No | Hides payment method logos displayed above the button. |

The tag generator in the form editor (Form editor → **ifthenpay Payment**) builds the tag for you with a visual UI.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this plugin require Contact Form 7?</strong></summary>

Yes. Contact Form 7 must be installed and active to use this plugin.

Without Contact Form 7, the plugin has no forms to attach payments to and will show an admin notice.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it support recurring payments?</strong></summary>

No. This version supports one-time payments via pay-by-link only.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are payment details stored?</strong></summary>

No. The plugin does not store card numbers or full bank details.

Only the minimal references required for payment matching and status updates are stored: transaction ID, amount, payment method, status, and form data.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which payment methods are supported?</strong></summary>

Any ifthenpay method attached to your Gateway Key, including:

* Multibanco
* MB WAY
* Payshop
* Credit Card
* Google Pay
* Apple Pay
* Pix

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the payment process work?</strong></summary>

After form submission, customers are redirected to a secure payment page hosted by ifthenpay. Once payment is completed, ifthenpay sends a server-side callback to automatically update the entry status.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if a payment fails or is cancelled?</strong></summary>

The entry is marked as Failed or Cancelled. The payment can be retried by re-submitting the form.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are payment entries stored?</strong></summary>

In a custom database table `wp_ifthenpay_cf7_entries`. View and manage them under **Contact Form 7 → ifthenpay Entries**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When do pending payments expire?</strong></summary>

A daily cron job runs at 23:59 and marks pending payments older than the configured number of days (default: 3) as expired. You can adjust the expiry period on the Integration settings page.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the payment amount come from a form field?</strong></summary>

Yes. In the per-form settings (form editor → **ifthenpay Payment Gateway** tab), set Payment Amount to **Read from CF7 field** and enter the field name whose value holds the amount.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there a sandbox / test mode?</strong></summary>

ifthenpay may provide test entities for development and testing purposes. If unavailable, we recommend using a low-value live transaction.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How secure is the integration?</strong></summary>

All requests are encrypted over HTTPS and no sensitive payment data is stored on your website. The callback endpoint validates an anti-phishing key and verifies the payment amount before updating any entry.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are payment links failing or setup timing out?</strong></summary>

Your server firewall or VPN may be blocking outbound requests. The plugin must connect to ifthenpay APIs to function. Ensure your network administrator allows outbound HTTPS traffic to ifthenpay domains.

</details>
