Adds ifthenpay payment methods to Contact Form 7: cards, wallets, and local payment options; supports secure one-time payments via pay-by-link.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates the ifthenpay payment gateway with Contact Form 7 to enable seamless payment collection directly from your forms. Payments are processed through a secure pay-by-link system, ensuring that no sensitive card or banking data is stored on your website. After form submission, customers are redirected to a secure ifthenpay payment page where they finalize the transaction. ifthenpay then sends a server-side callback to automatically update the payment status in your entries.

In plain terms you get:

* One-time payments directly from Contact Form 7 forms
* Secure automatic payment confirmations via callback
* Payment entries page to manage and track all transactions
* Revenue dashboard widget with period breakdown
* No card numbers stored on your website

All global settings are configured on the CF7 Integration page. Per-form settings (enable/disable, amount source) are managed inside each form editor.

= Key Features =

1. Full integration with Contact Form 7 forms
2. Secure transactions via pay-by-link
3. Automatic payment confirmation via server-side callback
4. Support for multiple payment methods (cards, wallets, bank transfers)
5. Per-form configuration — enable payments and set amount source per form
6. Flexible amount — fixed price or read dynamically from any CF7 field
7. Payment entries page with filtering, search, bulk actions, and column customization
8. Revenue dashboard widget with last 24 h / 7 d / 15 d / 30 d breakdown
9. Admin bar shortcut and keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+F) to Entries page
10. Multi-language support (EN, ES, FR, PT)
11. Security-first — no card data stored, anti-phishing key validation, HTTPS only

= Requirements =

* An active ifthenpay merchant account.
* The payment methods you want enabled (our helpdesk team will guide you).
* WordPress 6.5+ and PHP 8.2+, with Contact Form 7 5.9+ installed and activated.
* HTTPS (SSL) enabled on your site.

= Form Tag Reference =

The [ifthenpay_payment] tag renders the payment button in the form. Place it once where the submit button should appear and remove the default [submit] tag.

Supported options:

* amount:X.XX — (Required) Payment amount in euros. Use . or , as decimal separator.
* "Button text" — (Optional) Custom button label. Default: "Pay with ifthenpay".
* css:"my-class" — (Optional) Extra CSS class appended to the button element.
* hide:yes — (Optional) Hides the payment method logos displayed above the button.

The tag generator in the form editor builds the tag for you with a visual UI.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin zip via Plugins → Add New → Upload, or install from WordPress.org and Activate.
2. Go to Contact Form 7 → Integration → ifthenpay Payment Gateway, enter your Backoffice Key, and click Connect.
3. Select your Gateway Key, enable payment methods, set a default method, description, and expiry days. Click Save Configuration.
4. Open any form, go to the ifthenpay Payment Gateway tab, enable payments, and configure the payment amount (fixed or from a CF7 field).
5. Add the [ifthenpay_payment amount:XX.XX] tag to the form body using the tag generator. Remove the default submit button — the payment tag acts as the submit.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require Contact Form 7? =

Yes. Contact Form 7 must be installed and active to use this plugin.

Without Contact Form 7, the plugin has no forms to attach payments to and will show an admin notice.

= Does it support recurring payments? =

No. This version supports one-time payments via pay-by-link only.

= Are payment details stored? =

No. The plugin does not store card numbers or full bank details.

Only the minimal references required for payment matching and status updates are stored: transaction ID, amount, payment method, status, and form data.

= Which payment methods are supported? =

Any ifthenpay method attached to your Gateway Key, including Multibanco, MB WAY, Payshop, Credit Card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Pix.

= How does the payment process work? =

After form submission, customers are redirected to a secure payment page hosted by ifthenpay. Once payment is completed, ifthenpay sends a server-side callback to automatically update the entry status.

= What happens if a payment fails or is cancelled? =

The entry is marked as Failed or Cancelled. The payment can be retried by re-submitting the form.

= Where are payment entries stored? =

In a custom database table wp_ifthenpay_cf7_entries. View and manage them under Contact Form 7 → ifthenpay Entries.

= When do pending payments expire? =

A daily cron job runs at 23:59 and marks pending payments older than the configured number of days (default: 3) as expired. You can adjust the expiry period on the Integration settings page.

= Can the payment amount come from a form field? =

Yes. In the per-form settings (form editor → ifthenpay Payment Gateway tab), set Payment Amount to "Read from CF7 field" and enter the field name whose value holds the amount.

= Is there a sandbox / test mode? =

ifthenpay may provide test entities for development and testing purposes. If unavailable, we recommend using a low-value live transaction.

= How secure is the integration? =

All requests are encrypted over HTTPS and no sensitive payment data is stored on your website. The callback endpoint validates an anti-phishing key and verifies the payment amount before updating any entry.

=Why are payment links failing or setup timing out?=

Your server firewall or VPN may be blocking outbound requests. The plugin must connect to ifthenpay APIs to function. Ensure your network administrator allows outbound HTTPS traffic to ifthenpay domains.
